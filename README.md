## History

Many people such as high school and college students often are interested in fashion. They are looking for new fashion and styles to experiment with but often find the most popular options seen on influencers and social networks are out of my price ranges. As such, there is a need for a social networking app entirely dedicated to budget fashion where users can find and share their outfits/inspirations. Fashion and trends should be accessible for everyone especially students and others who might not have the budget for designer brands.

I'm always looking out for new fashion and styles to experiment with, but often find the most popular options seen on influencers and social networks are out of my price ranges. Therefore, I want to create a social networking app entirely dedicated to budget fashion, where users can share their outfits and find inspirations as well as possible new stores from others.

While most social networks with a photo-posting function can do this, I want to build a community dedicated to making fashion and trends as accessible as possible for everyone, especially students and others who might not have the budget for designer brands.
